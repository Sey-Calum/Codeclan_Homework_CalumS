  #Question 1
I want to predict how well 6 year-olds are going to do in their final school exams. Using the following variables am I likely under-fitting, fitting well or over-fitting? Postcode, gender, reading level, score in maths test, date of birth, family income.

ANSWER
Likely to over-fit the prediction, as there is an overload of variables.


  #Question 2
If I have two models, one with an AIC score of 34,902 and the other with an AIC score of 33,559 which model should I use?

ANSWER
You should use the lower score, being 33,559. As for AIC and BIC a lower score is better


  #Question 3 
I have two models, the first with: r-squared: 0.44, adjusted r-squared: 0.43. The second with: r-squared: 0.47, adjusted r-squared: 0.41. Which one should I use?

ANSWER
You should use the first model. As a larger adjusted r-squared value is better


  #Question 4
I have a model with the following errors: RMSE error on test set: 10.3, RMSE error on training data: 10.4. Do you think this model is over-fitting?

ANSWER
I do not believe the model to be over-fitted. 


  #Question 5
How does k-fold validation work?

ANSWER
Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into.


  #Question 6
What is a validation set? When do you need one?

ANSWER
A set of examples used to tune the parameters of a classifier, for example to choose the number of hidden units in a neural network. â€“ Test set: A set of examples used only to assess the performance of a fully-specified classifier. These are the recommended definitions and usages of the terms.


  #Question 7
Describe how backwards selection works.

ANSWER
This approach involves either forward selection, adding features one at a time, or backward selection, removing features one at a time until some criterion is reached. Additionally, a bidirectional selection method is available that involves adding or removing a feature at each step.


  #Question 8
Describe how best subset selection works

ANSWER
Subset selection refers to the task of finding a small subset of the available independent variables that does a good job of predicting the dependent variable.


  #Question 9
It is estimated on 5% of model projects end up being deployed. What actions can you take to maximise the likelihood of your model being deployed?

ANSWER
- Future proofing the model is a must. As project plans often change, sometimes quite drastically over the process of a project. 
- Having a range of predictors


  #Question 10
What metric could you use to confirm that the recent population is similar to the development population?
  
ANSWER
Population Stability Index - (PSI)

  
  #Question 11
How is the Population Stability Index defined? What does this mean in words?

ANSWER
In simple words, Population Stability Index (PSI) compares the distribution of a scoring variable (predicted probability) in scoring data set to a training data set that was used to develop the model.


  #Question 12
Above what PSI value might we need to start to consider rebuilding or recalibrating the model

ANSWER
