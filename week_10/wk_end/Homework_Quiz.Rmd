Homework Quiz - 10th of January 2021

Calum Sey - Code Clan

Question 1

I want to predict how well 6 year-olds are going to do in their final school exams. Using the following variables am I likely under-fitting, fitting well or over-fitting? Postcode, gender, reading level, score in maths test, date of birth, family income.

Likely to over-fit the prediction, as there is an overload of varaibles.


Question 2

If I have two models, one with an AIC score of 34,902 and the other with an AIC score of 33,559 which model should I use?
