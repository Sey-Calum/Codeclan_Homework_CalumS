Decision trees homework - 12th of January 2021

Calum Sey - CodeClan

```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(tidyverse)

library(tidyverse)
titanic_set <- read_csv('data/titanic_decision_tree_data.csv')

shuffle_index <- sample(1:nrow(titanic_set))

# shuffle the data so class order isn't in order - need this for training/testing split later on 
titanic_set <- titanic_set[shuffle_index, ]
```

Question 1 

Cleaning up the data is always the first step. Do the following:

Take only observations which have a survived flag (i.e. that aren’t missing)
Turn your important variables into factors (sex, survived, pclass, embarkation)
Create an age_status variable which groups individuals under (and including) 16 years of age into a category called “child” category and those over 16 into a category called “adult”.
Drop the NA
Drop any variables you don’t need (X1, passenger_id, name, ticket, far, cabin)
If you need help doing this, the code is below, but please try it yourself first so you can learn!
